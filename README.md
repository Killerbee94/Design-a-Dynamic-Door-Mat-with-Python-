Question :
Write a Python function to generate a decorative door mat pattern. The mat should have the following features:
The size of the mat is determined by two inputs: N (height) and M (width).
N must be an odd number, and M must be exactly three times N (M = 3 * N).
The mat's pattern includes:
A top section with a series of rows containing the string .|. repeated an increasing odd number of times, centered and padded with -.
A middle row with the word "WELCOME" centered and padded with -.
A bottom section that mirrors the top section, with decreasing odd repetitions of .|.  .
